SpriteHelper
============
A little helper for working with sprites.

It allows you to have a visual feedback of how your spritesheet will look like on your LOVE2D game.

It uses LOVE2D, AnAL and Quickie. And of course, lua.

To run do:

    $ love SpriteHelper/

To change the image:

Well, change the file named img.png inside the folder.
In the current version it has to be named img.png
